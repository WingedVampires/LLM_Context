You will receive:

1. An issue description.
2. The Cypher reasoning and queries used to search the graph.
3. The retrieval results from the graph database.

The retrieval results are provided in the following format:
## Retrieval Results
### Result <id>
- query_id: <id of the Cypher/Natural Language query that produced this result>
- <Searched Key>: <Searched Value>

There may be multiple results:

```text
## Cypher Retrieval Results
{cypher_search_result}

## Natural Language Retrieval Results
{natural_language_search_result}
```
Let's analyze collected context first and based on your analysis, answer below questions one by one:
1. do we need more context: construct new cypher queries to get more context of the project. (say 'no' if you don't need more context)
2. is the information enough to answer the raw question. (say 'no' if you don't have enough information)
